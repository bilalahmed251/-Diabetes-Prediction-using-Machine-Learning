# -Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
his project uses PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset to predict whether a person has diabetes based on diagnostic features such as glucose level, BMI, and age using different classification models.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
Clean and preprocess raw medical data
Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
Train multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
Evaluate models using classification metrics and ROC-AUC
Interpret the best model using SHAP
Tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV
Save the final model for deployment

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
SHAP
SMOTE (Imbalanced-learn)
Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Š Visualizations
Include screenshots like:
Class distribution chart
ROC curve of all models
SHAP feature importance plot
